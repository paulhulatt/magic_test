MAGIC Tech Test

## Getting Started

Tech Test project for MAGIC contract position interview process

I've used my preferred MVVM architecture which (in my opinion) helps maintains excellent code separation & readability and makes future cross-platform & responsive layout development much easier.  To aid this I have also used the "stacked" & "stacked_services" packages which help speed development by providing all the boilerplate code for ViewModel & State management.

Other packages used are:

 - intl:  Used for date formatting
 - uuid:  Used to generate
 - shared_preferences:  Used for data storage in this example

In an ideal world I would implement "Swipe to delete" on both the Workout & Sets lists however I have left that out of this demo as it's probably out of the scope of what was requested.

Unit Tests are not currently working as that is a gap in my knowledge currently due to my previous positions held but I am working on rectifying that will be using this project as a means of testing myself.
